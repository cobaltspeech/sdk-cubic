The Cubic API is specified as a [proto
file](https://github.com/cobaltspeech/sdk-cubic/blob/master/grpc/cubic.proto).
This section of the documentation is auto-generated from the spec.  It describes
the data types and functions defined in the spec. The "messages" below
correspond to the data structures to be used, and the "service" contains the
methods that can be called.
